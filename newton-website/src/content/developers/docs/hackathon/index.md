## Hackathon

The Newton Hackathon welcomes bright minds and talents from around the world to work to create transformative technology projects with us together.

The workshop will allow participants to participate in searching the science & technology & design product & community, learn together to create professional blockchain-based solutions, and gain a discussion space for technical learning.

**_Here are the instructions for the Newton community hackathon:_**

1. Shortly description of your topic for the community. Point in the shining direction.
2. All participants can build their projects within a limited time, and the best ones emerge as a new product or service and enter the hackathon's prize pool.
3. They will open a Learning Innovation Request for setting science & technology & design product & community.
4. The hackathon is a mix of fun, with coding, designing, and marketing working together in teams for accelerated productivity.
5. The Newton community will provide an easy way to integrate participants into Github and include any relevant environment variables or constraints required for the project to function.

## About us

Newton is a blockchain-based community economic infrastructure platform. It is a community economy managed by a non-profit foundation that provides services such as decentralized digital wallets, buying and selling digital collections, mining, trading encrypted assets, and entering Metaverse. We build and deploy cutting-edge technologies to create a more decentralized and secure blockchain ecosystem and realize the application of blockchain. Under Newton's governance, the blockchain can automatically generate credit in a free, open, and peer-to-peer manner without needing authoritative intermediaries.

## Join us

Our vision is to create a more decentralized virtual world where players can earn as useful rewards as possible in the digital space. Successful players can grow their online empire with a group of friends. Hackathons can bring together many people who don't know each other at a specific time to do what they want in the way they want. Excellent development talents are extremely rare, and the era of science & technology & design products & community will be a challenge for technicians and developers.

## Tips for participants

• Shine in front of tech learners by presenting your project.

• Understanding the concept and application of themes deeply.

• Determine the theme and innovation direction immediately, and prevent sudden changes.
We understand that there are always many ideas, and now and then, an idea pops up. Based on the Newton community, Hackathon is a limited-time event, and there is not that much time for participants to change and trial and error. Therefore, determine the theme as early as possible before participating. Once the discussion is clear and the composition is defined, please do not change it later.

• The Newton community will care about the ideas provided by each participant and hope that you can choose the most suitable team member or choose a project that matches the member's ability and enter our hackathon channel.
